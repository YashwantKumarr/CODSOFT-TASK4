In Task 4 of my CodSoft Internship, I developed a Rock Paper Scissors game using Python and Tkinter. The project features a modern GUI, real-time score tracking, and an interactive experience with user vs computer gameplay. It includes a “Play Again” option, clear instructions, and visually appealing buttons — making it both fun and educational!
